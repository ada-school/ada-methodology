## 🌱 What is the ADA Methodology?

The **ADA Methodology (Applied Digital Apprenticeship)** is an educational approach developed by <a href="https://ada-school.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Ada School</strong></a> that emphasizes the progressive development of workplace skills through **experimentation, guided practice, and real-world application**.

📜 Inspired by the proverb of Confucius:

> 🐵 **"I hear and I forget, I see and I remember, I do and I understand."**

This methodology offers a structured path for professional learning through **micro-credentials or micro-courses**, with a hands-on learning focus.

---

## 🌟 Purpose of this Open Technology

- 📖 Share a competency-based training model for digital skills.
- 🧠 Enable the creation of practical, job-ready learning experiences.
- 🤝 Foster collaboration among educators, professionals, and tech institutions.

## 🔍 Learning Structure

Each **ADA Microcourse** is structured in **4 key phases**, inspired by the **three wise monkeys** 🐒 and a collaborative phase 🐵 that represents the full journey toward comprehension:

---

### 🧬 Learning Atoms

The ADA methodology is built around **Learning Atoms**—modular, reusable units that combine theory, example, and brief practice. These atoms can be implemented in any phase of the microcourse.

📌 They allow you to design a course as a sequence of components with increasing complexity, aligned with **Bloom’s Taxonomy**, facilitating progressive skills acquisition.

🔗 By combining learning atoms of varying complexity, learners can follow personalized and modular learning paths that move from foundational understanding to real-world application.
