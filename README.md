## 🎯 Pedagogical Principle

> “I hear and I forget, I see and I remember, I do and I understand, I share and I multiply.”

The ADA methodology promotes experiential and progressive learning, focused on developing real-world professional competencies. Microcourses are structured into modules, with **learning atoms** as the minimum didactic unit and **collaborative human spaces** to foster interaction.

---

## 🧬 Learning Atom: Foundational Modular Unit

Each atom combines content and experiences around a specific competency, using various formats to maximize understanding, retention, and application.

| Type     | Pedagogical Purpose                        | Resource Examples                                        |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Read     | Introduce and contextualize concepts       | Articles, infographics, case studies, interactive guides |
| Listen   | Connect emotionally and reinforce concepts | Podcasts, interviews, narrated explanations              |
| Watch    | Model or demonstrate processes             | Videos, animations, simulations, visual examples         |
| Practice | Apply knowledge in practical contexts      | Labs, step-by-step challenges, simulations               |
| Evaluate | Validate comprehension and performance     | Interactive quizzes, rubrics, AI-evaluable prompts       |

Atoms can be composed and recombined depending on learning styles, module objectives, and Bloom's taxonomy levels.

## 🧱 ADA Microcourse Modular Structure

Each microcourse includes up to three modules with the following structure:

1. **Module name**: Thematic focus
2. **Target competency**: Linked to job profiles
3. **Tools and resources**: Platforms and technologies
4. **Learning objectives** (based on Bloom's taxonomy):

   * Remember: Identify, list, recognize
   * Understand: Explain, summarize, interpret
   * Apply: Use, execute, implement
5. **Learning atoms** mapped to each objective
6. **Lab or challenge**: Formative evaluation
7. **Assessment**: Automated or manual (AI or rubric-based)
8. **Deliverable**: Digital product, reflection, prototype, or shareable project

## 🔄 ADA Learning Phases

### 🙊 Phase 1: Hear and Forget — *Self-Guided Learning*

> “I hear and I forget.” — Confucius

**Objective:** Introduce key concepts through audio and visual materials.

**Includes:**

* Illustrated and interactive readings
* Short explanatory videos
* Real success or failure stories
* Podcasts and narrated explanations
* Checks for understanding: interactive quizzes
* Online lecture or workshop to promote human collaboration.

### 🙉 Phase 2: See and Remember — *Visual Exploration*

> “I see and I remember.” — Confucius

**Objective:** Reinforce learning through visual and experimental activities.

**Includes:**

* Labs with guided steps
* Guided experiments
* Simulations with feedback
* Practical case studies
* AI-assisted personalized feedback

### 🙈 Phase 3: Do and Understand — *Practical Application*

> “I do and I understand.” — Confucius

**Objective:** Apply knowledge in real-world scenarios.

**Includes:**

* Capstone project based on real cases
* Customizable evaluation rubrics
* Feedback by peers or AI evaluation
* Digital badge or certificate

### 🐵 Phase 4: Share and Multiply — *Collaborate and Create*

> “I share and I multiply.” — Ada School

**Objective:** Empower collaborative and social learning.

**Includes:**

* Group activities (synchronous or asynchronous)
* Peer reflection forums
* Live sessions with mentors or guests
* Hybrid collaboration spaces
* Project co-creation
* Peer feedback and community engagement
* Project presentations

## 🧰 Build Your ADA Microcourse in 7 Steps

1. Choose a real-world competency
2. Define one learning objective for each level (remember, understand, apply)
3. Design matching learning atoms
4. Create a lab or practical experience
5. Set up formative evaluation with rubric or AI
6. Specify the deliverable
7. Include collaborative spaces and peer feedback

---

## 📄 Certification and Evidence

* Evidence of job-ready skills
