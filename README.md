## 🧠 What is the ADA Learning Atom Methodology?

The **ADA Methodology (Applied Digital Apprenticeship)** is an educational approach developed by [**Ada School**](https://ada-school.org/) that emphasizes the progressive development of workplace skills through **experimentation, guided practice, and real-world application**.

📜 Inspired by the proverb of Confucius:

> 🐵 **"I hear and I forget, I see and I remember, I do and I understand."**

This methodology offers a structured path for professional learning through **micro-credentials or micro-courses**, with a hands-on learning focus.

---

## 🌟 Purpose of this Open Technology

* 📖 Share a competency-based training model for digital skills.
* 🧠 Enable the creation of practical, job-ready learning experiences.
* 🤝 Foster collaboration among educators, professionals, and tech institutions.

## 🧬 ADA Learning Atom Methodology

Each **Learning Atom** is a balanced **micro-learning experience** that nurtures **self-learning skills**, scaffolded by a platform that provides multimodal content and formative feedback. At its core, an atom enables autonomy through structure and practical application.

### 🧰 Definition

A **Learning Atom** is the smallest pedagogical unit in the ADA Methodology. Each atom is organized around a practical learning objective and integrates self-directed exploration, diverse media, and formative assessment.

Atoms are modular and composable—they can stand alone or be grouped into sprints, bootcamps, or full programs.

### 🌐 Core Philosophy

> “Autonomy through scaffolding.”

Atoms help learners develop self-regulated learning through four interconnected learning modes:

### 🎯 Atom Framework: The Four Learning Modes

| Mode            | Description                                           | Learning Objects Supported                          |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Read**     | Comprehend via text and visual concepts               | Articles, case studies, analogies, examples         |
| **2. Hear**     | Understand through storytelling and narration         | Podcasts, audio files, anecdotes                    |
| **3. View**     | Visualize and absorb through multimedia               | Explainer videos, animations, TikTok-style capsules |
| **4. Practice** | Apply in context using interactive and hands-on tools | Labs, AI prompts, Code Challenges, Projects         |

## 🧬 Atom Structure

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/ada-school/metodologia/raw/main/img/ada-learning-atom.svg" alt="Learning Atom Structure" width="600">
</p>


Each atom includes:

1. **Title** – Skill-centered and descriptive
2. **Description** – Why the concept matters
3. **Learning Objectives** – One for conceptual understanding (Bloom Level 1–2), another for application (Level 3+)
4. **Context** – A scenario or story
5. **Modes 1–4**:

   * Learners can start with any mode; the platform guides to balance
6. **Feedback**:

   * **Quizzes** (T/F, multiple choice, trivias)
   * **AI-graded open questions** (score 0–100 with feedback)
7. **Assessment**:

   * Code challenges, projects, or guided labs
8. **Time Estimate**: 20–60 minutes per atom

### 🛠️ Learning Objects

| Object            | Use                          | Tools                       |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 📘 Article        | Explain concepts             | Markdown, Notion            |
| ❓ Quiz            | Test understanding           | Trivia, MCQ                 |
| 📽️ Video         | Explain visually             | YouTube, Vimeo              |
| 🎧 Audio          | Complement with narration    | Google Drive, Spotify       |
| 🤖 AI Question    | Reflect and receive feedback | Open text + AI scoring      |
| 💻 Code Challenge | Solve in IDE with test cases | Unit test runner            |
| 💡 Code Project   | Real repo challenge (TDD)    | GitHub repo + failing tests |
| 🧪 Lab            | Step-by-step guided activity | Manual or auto-evaluated    |

## 🔄 From Atom to Experience

Atoms can be combined to form:

* **Sprints** (a sequence of 3–5 Atoms)
* **Microcredentials** (competency-based microcourses)
* **Bootcamps** (project-driven programs)
* **Certifications** (aligned to Bloom + industry skill frameworks)

## 💼 Learning Outcomes

1. 🧠 Comprehend digital and technical concepts
2. 📝 Apply skills in context and solve real-world challenges
3. 🤝 Collaborate, reflect, and adapt learning strategies
4. 📊 Demonstrate mastery through application and feedback
