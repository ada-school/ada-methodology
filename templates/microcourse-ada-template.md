## 🎓 Microcourse Title
Example: Introduction to Data Visualization with Python

## ⏳ Estimated Duration
Example: 3 weeks · 8 hours/week

## 🎯 Learning Goal
Describe the digital skill the learner will develop, its relevance to the job market, and how it contributes to real-world performance.

## 🔑 Prerequisites
List previous knowledge or skills needed to enroll:
- [ ] Basic Python programming
- [ ] Data manipulation with pandas

## 💡 Skills to Be Developed
- Use matplotlib and seaborn to visualize data
- Analyze trends using basic statistical charts
- Communicate insights through visual storytelling

### 🙈 Phase 2: See and Remember – *Labs*
> _"I see and I remember."_

- 🧪 Guided labs and practice tasks
- 🔁 Trial-and-error learning
- 🤖 Formative assessments evaluated by AI (customizable prompts)
- 🧪 Programming tasks with Unit Tests
- 📈 Feedback loops and iterations

### 🙉 Phase 3: Do and Understand – *Capstone Project*
> _"I do and I understand."_
